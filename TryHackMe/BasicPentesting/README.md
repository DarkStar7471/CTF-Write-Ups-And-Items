​	*A room created with the purpose of practicing basic pentesting skills*

***Special Notes:***

- Prior to attempting this room, it's worthwhile to download a Kali Linux VM from this link:
  - Link: https://www.kali.org/downloads/
- Additionally, I highly recommend setting up Virtual Box in order to run this machine:

***Instructions:***

- First, as we start many boxes, let's begin with an Nmap scan.
  - ![alt text](./images/nmap.png?raw=true "nmap")
  - Switches used:
    - -sV : Service version scan
    - -vv : Very verbose (output during scan)
- Here's our initial scan results:
  - ![alt text](./images/nmap-results.png?raw=true "nmap-results")
  - We can see the following ports/services are exposed:
    - 22   : SSH
    - 80   : HTTP Web Server
    - 139  : NetBIOS/Samba
    - 445  : NetBIOS/Samba
    - 8009 : Apache Jserv
    - 8080 : Apache Tomcat, Another HTTP Web Server*
      - *This is a very common port for Admins to move/hide a web server at*
- Let's go ahead and check out that website
  - ![alt text](./images/80-website.png?raw=true "80-source")
- Under maintenance? Let's check the source
  - ![alt text](./images/80-website-source.png?raw=true "")
- Let's see if we can find that development section.
  - *Note in this section I suggest first checking /dev/, in this case I have checked that and moved onto the natural extension of that initial check, development*
  - ![alt text](./images/80-website-development.png?raw=true "development")
- Interesting, let's take a look at both of these files
  - ![alt text](./images/dev-txt.png?raw=true "dev-txt")
- Seems like the creators of this website have been working on some side projects, we might have a look back at this version later
  - ![alt text](./images/j-txt.png?raw=true "j-txt")
- Weak passwords? Sounds like we're going to be doing some bruteforcing later. Let's see if we can find out exactly who J and K are through enumeration. I'll be using enum4linux
  - ![alt text](./images/.png?raw=true "")
  - ![alt text](./images/.png?raw=true "")
- There's our users! Since J has the weak password, let's try using hydra against his user on SSH
  - *Use the modified wordlist added to this write-up directory on github. It's a shortened version of rockyou.txt in order to reduce the bruteforcing time*
  - ![alt text](./images/.png?raw=true "")
  - ![alt text](./images/.png?raw=true "")
- Since we can log in now, let's do exactly that
